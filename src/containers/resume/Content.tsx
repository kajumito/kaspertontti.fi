            After two years of my studies I started working in academic research
            group. I worked as a lead developer for multiple projects related to
            decentralized app development, and also created and maintained a
            private Ethereum network which was used for development purposes by
            our research group. One of my major responsibilities was to teach
            smart contract development for over 60 BSc & MSc students on a
            decentralized application development course.
